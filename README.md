# Python Automation — Product Registration

This project contains a Python script designed to automate the process of registering products into a storage base or dataset.  
Its main goal is to demonstrate how Python can be used to automate repetitive tasks involving data handling.

## Project Overview

The automation reads product information from a structured source and processes it programmatically, reducing manual effort and minimizing errors during data registration.

This repository is intended for learning and demonstration purposes, focusing on:
- Python scripting
- Basic data automation
- File-based data processing

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `project.py` — Main automation script
- `produtos.csv` — Sample product database used as input
- `README.md` — Project documentation

## Features

- Reads product data from a CSV file
- Automates the product registration process
- Simple and easy-to-understand Python logic
- Easily extensible for databases or APIs

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Additional libraries may be required depending on future extensions

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/etiennelima/python_automation.git
   cd python_automation
